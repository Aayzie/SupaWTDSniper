### Immediately join a room that Forsen is in, before he even posts the code on Discord

## How to use
Simply **copy and paste** everything from wtdsniper.js to the console, then press Enter.

Modify *_targetName* if you want to target another streamer.

If the room requires Twitch Login, make sure you login to Twitch first before pasting and executing the code.

If you don't know how to open the console, press F12 in your browser then go here:

## How it works
When a player joins a room, this script will automatically make you join that room.

If that someone is Forsen (or whoever your target streamer is), you stay in that room. Otherwise, you disconnect and wait for another player to join a room.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to keep the WTD tab visible. Switching to another browser tab or alt-tabbing will make you disconnect from the server. If you wanna watch forsen's stream while using this script, do it in another window.

## Known Issues
If Forsen joins his room while you are still being connected/disconnected from another room, the script will not make you join his room until someone else joins it.
