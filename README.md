# SupaWTDSniper
 Immediately joins the room that forsen joins in, before he even posts the code on Discord

## How to use
Simply **copy and paste** everything from wtdsniper.js to the console, then press Enter.

Modify *_yourName* to whatever you want your in-game name to be.

Modify *_targetName* if you want to target another streamer.

If you don't know how to open the console, press F12 in your browser then go here:

## How it works
When a player joins a room, this script will automatically make you join that room.

If that someone is Forsen (or whoever your target streamer is), you stay in that room. Otherwise, you disconnect and wait for another player to join a room.
